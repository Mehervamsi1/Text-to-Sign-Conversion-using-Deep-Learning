# Word to Wave
What are we doing?
Project Overview: Our project, titled "Word to Wave," aims to develop a system that converts spoken language into sign language animations. This is designed to aid verbally challenged individuals and those with hearing impairments by providing them with a tool to better understand spoken language through visual gestures.

Objectives:
Voice Input to Text Conversion: Utilize speech recognition technologies to convert voice inputs into text.

Text to Sign Language Translation: Apply machine learning models to translate the recognized text into corresponding sign language gestures.

Sign Language Animation: Create and animate 3D models to visually represent the translated sign language gestures.

Why are we doing it?
This project aims to bridge the communication gap for people who are verbally challenged or have hearing impairments. By converting spoken language into sign language animations, we can provide an accessible means for these individuals to understand and participate in conversations, enhancing their ability to communicate and interact with others.

What will success look like?
Success for the "Word to Wave" project will be defined by the following milestones:

Accurate Speech Recognition: The system reliably converts spoken input into accurate text, with minimal errors.

Effective Translation to Sign Language: The text is correctly translated into sign language gestures that are comprehensible and accurate according to standardized sign language.

Seamless Animation: The 3D hand animations are smooth, realistic, and accurately represent the intended sign language gestures.

User Satisfaction: The end-users, particularly those who are verbally challenged or have hearing impairments, find the tool useful and effective in improving their communication.
